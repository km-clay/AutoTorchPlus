[i/8] AutoTorch+

This mod automatically places torches from your inventory at configurable intervals. Has some nice features:

- Configurable placement radius around the character
- Configurable distance between torches
- A "smart placement" mode that accounts for tiles inbetween torches (toggle-able)
- Automatic placement of biome torches instead of normal ones (toggle-able)
- A toggle hotkey for turning the automatic torch placement on/off
- Torch placement respects the on/off state of Torch God's Favor, meaning regular torches will be converted to biome torches.
- Includes a setting that will automatically replace existing torches with the right biome torches if they are available, or if Torch God's Favor is enabled.
